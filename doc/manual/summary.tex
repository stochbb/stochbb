\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \pkg{StochBB} allows to analyze systems of dependent random variables efficiently without resorting to stochastic simulation.
 \item It uses analytic solutions for the marginal distributions if possible and resorts to numerical approximations if necessary.
 \item To this end, it reveals a surprising good precision. One that would require a large amount of samples to achieve same precision using stochastic simulation.
 \item The GUI eases the assembly of complex networks that are mend to describe random models like those typical for cognitive psychology.
 \item The software (including the core library, interfaces to \proglang{Python} and \proglang{R} as well as the graphical user interface) is available under the General Public License version 3 at \texttt{https://github.com/stochbb}.
