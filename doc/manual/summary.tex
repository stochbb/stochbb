\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \pkg{StochBB} allows to analyze systems of dependent random variables efficiently without resorting to stochastic simulation.
 \item It uses analytic solutions for the marginal distributions if possible and resorts to numerical approximations if necessary.
 \item To this end, it reveals a surprising good precision. One that would require a large amount of samples to achieve same precision using stochastic simulation.
 \item With this high precision, it is possible to fit networks of random variables to data by means of maximum likelihood or minimizing the KS-statistic.
 \item The GUI eases assembling of complex networks that are mend to describe random models like those typical for cognitive psychology by providing an abstract semantics related to \emph{stochastic processing stages} rather than \emph{random variables}.
 \item The software (including the core library, interfaces to \proglang{Python} and \proglang{R} as well as the graphical user interface) is available under the General Public License version 3 at \texttt{https://github.com/stochbb}.
