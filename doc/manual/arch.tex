\section{Software architecture}
In this section, I briefly describe the software architecture of the complete \pkg{StochBB}
framework as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:arch}.

The foundation of the complete framework is formed by the \pkg{StochBB} core library. This C++
library implements the core functionality of the system. Prominent elements are classes
representing atomic random-variables, parametric distributions as well as derived
variables (e.g., sums of random variables) and their distributions (e.g., convolution densities).  
Together, these classes form the representation of a complex system of dependent random variables.
Analytic solutions for some marginal distributions are obtained by reduction and transformation
operations performed on the system representation. These operations are also part of the core
library. Finally a set of numerical algorithms (e.g., numerical convolution and integrals) where
implemented for obtaining numerical approximations of densities which cannot
be derived analytically. 

Using the core library directly would rather be complicated as C++ does not provide automatic
memory management. For easing the usage of the core library an application programming interface
(API) is provided for the core library that encapsulates all objects of the core library into
container classes. These container classes then implement an automatic memory management by
means of a \emph{mark-and-sweep} garbage collector \cite[e.g.,][]{Aho2007}. This API (described
in Appendix \ref{sec:api} below) is then used to provide interfaces to the Python and R programming
language as well as implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) application described in Section 
\ref{sec:gui} below.
