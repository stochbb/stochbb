<p> StochBB is a software tool to assemble and analyze complex systems of dependent random
 variables. Usually such systems are analyzed by means of Monte Carlo simulation. StochBB uses a
 different approach. Instead of sampling from these dependent random variables, it obtains thier
 marginal probability distributions analytically or resorts to numerical approximations where
 necessary. To this end, StochBB allows to assemble complex systems of random variables and analyze
 them efficiently. </p>
